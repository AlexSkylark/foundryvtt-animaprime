# Anima Prime: REBOOT

This system is a modified implementation of the **Anima Prime: Resurgence** RPG system with modifications to make it more suited to use in Virtual Tabletops, mainly Foundry VTT. This project aims to be a hack of the original Anima Prime: Resurgence 

 The original *Anima Prime: Resurgence* shystem was created by C. W. Griffen and can be found at at https://cwgriffen.itch.io/anima-prime-resurgence

## Modifications

As some people are getting the link and might be interested in trying out the system, I've compiled a quick summary of the modifications done to the *Resurgence* version of the system so you're not entirely lost if you're interested in downloading it and trying out yourselves:

- Backgrounds do not give you abilities anymore. Instead, it comfers you 3 traits/skills

- There are no "training" or "skills". Those were merged into **Traits and Abilities**, which are freeform traits and skills (as the name says) which are given by both your profession (3 of them) and your background (more 3), for a total of 6 abilities for a starting character. Abilities can be a skill like "Driving" or "Animal Handling" or "Knowledge: History", or they can also represent a trait like "High Intelligence", "High Agility" or "High Charisma". A comprehensive list of traits and abilities is planned for the Anima Prime: REBOOT release  

  Those function as described in the "unofficial Anima Prime 1.5" document (that can be found at https://divnull.com/blog/2019/anima-prime-1-5/), as follows:

  *When you attempt to do something difficult or opposed by another character during a character scene, describe to the GM what you’re doing and figure out together which skill that uses. The GM will also inform you what the difficulty of the roll is (a number between 3 for regular and 6 for nearly-impossible attempts). Then roll your skill rating in dice; if you don’t have that skill, roll two dice instead **(that is accomplished by using the GENERIC ROLL button at the top of the section)**.Count the number of dice that show the difficulty or higher as successes and check the result below*

   - 0 successes: Failure. Whatever you were trying to do it not accomplished
   - 1 success: Partial Success. Either something goes bad with the attempt, or you only get a general, far0sighted result.
   - 2-3 successes: Complete Success. You accomplish what you were trying to do
   - 4+ successes: Extra/Critical Success. You accomplish what you were trying to do, plus some extra effect.

  Upon character creation, the owner is supposed to take their initial traits/abilities and choose one to set at rating 5, and two to set at rating 4, leaving the remainder at rating 3.

- (CURRENTLY PLAYTESTING) - Successes in strike/achievement rolls are achieved with rolling 4 or higher, up from 3 at the *Resurgence* system.

- The *goals* mechanic for now are working as a simplified version of the ones found in the *Resurgence* system as they don't have 2 sides. I expect to revamp and modify the goal system as playtest revealed the current one to be lacking in engagement for VTT groups.

- (CURRENTLY PLAYTESTING) - A new type of character - ALLIES. These are characters that are controlled by the GM but they fight as the friendly team. They can only take a turn after all player characters had taken a turn, and they work as adversities (can't do style maneuvers)

## TODO / Roadmap
- More playtesting, MUCH MORE PLAYTESTING
- Add Localization
- Write the PDF document for Anima Prime: REBOOT
