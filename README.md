# Anima Prime: Resurgence System

This system is an unofficial implementation of the Anima Prime: Resurgence RPG system for use in Foundry VTT. It was mainly built for use in a private campaign, and as such it has some minor modifications done to the system after playtesting, but large and by it's the same system as described by C. W. Griffen at https://cwgriffen.itch.io/anima-prime-resurgence
